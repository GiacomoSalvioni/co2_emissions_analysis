# co2_emissions_analysis
Analysis of global CO₂ emissions with future scenarios and decoupling targets for climate policy

This repository provides a full analytical workflow to explore global CO₂ emissions using public open datasets from _Our World in Data_, the _Global Carbon Budget_, and the _UN Population Prospects_.

The project covers:

- Historical emissions (absolute & per capita)
- Differences in energy mix and emission sources
- Four global emission scenarios up to 2100
- A per-capita carbon budget model for 2°C
- Required reductions by income level

All analysis is done in Python through reproducible Jupyter notebooks.

# co2 emissions analysis
Analysis of global CO₂ emissions with future scenarios and decoupling targets for climate policy


All analysis is done in Python through reproducible Jupyter notebooks.


This project was born from the idea of taking a complex and highly relevant topic like global CO₂ emissions and using it as a sandbox to test and improve my technical skills in Python, data analysis, and visualization while connecting everything to my professional background in ESG and sustainability.

It is not a scientific publication or a forecasting model.
It is a skills building project, designed to show how I work with data and how I interpret results through an ESG lens.

I chose climate data because it sits naturally at the intersection between my career experience and my learning journey. All analysis is written in Python using publicly available datasets from Our World in Data, the Global Carbon Project, and the United Nations.

AI played a supportive role: I used it for brainstorming, checking formulas, debugging, and refining English text (not my native language). The ideas, methodology, analysis design, and conclusions are completely my own.


The repository contains five notebooks, each focused on a specific part of the analysis but structured as one coherent story:

- Data Cleaning & Merge - integration and preprocessing of multiple datasets (CO₂, per capita, population, energy sources, GDP).
- Exploratory Analysis - comparison of major emitters, per-capita analysis, and identification of emission patterns.
- Emission Source Composition - breakdown of emissions by source (coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, industry) and interpretation of national energy profiles.
- Future Scenarios (2025–2100) - simple “what-if” scenarios: frozen per-capita, EU-level convergence, global average, and Net Zero 2050.
- Carbon Budget & Equity - estimating required per capita reductions for high-income countries to remain within a 2°C carbon budget.

All charts are saved in outputs/figures.

This project is part of my upskilling journey and reflects how I approach a complex problem, organize the workflow, and turn raw data into accessible insights.

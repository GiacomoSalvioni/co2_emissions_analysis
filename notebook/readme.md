This folder contains the five Jupyter notebooks that structure the analysis.
Each notebook focuses on one step of the workflow — from loading and cleaning the data to building scenarios and evaluating the carbon-budget implications.

The notebooks are designed to be read sequentially:

01_data_cleaning.ipynb – Loads the raw OWID datasets, merges them, and applies all cleaning steps used for the project.

02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb – Identifies top emitters, explores per-capita differences, and establishes the main emission patterns.

03_source_composition_analysis.ipynb – Examines how coal, oil, gas, cement, and other sources contribute to national emissions, with a focus on major emitters.

04_future_scenarios.ipynb – Builds simple “what-if” emission scenarios (frozen per-capita, EU convergence, world convergence, net-zero by 2050).

05_carbon_budget_analysis.ipynb – Computes the sustainable per-capita budget and estimates required reductions for high-income countries.
